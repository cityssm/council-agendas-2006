Hayes  Seconded by   Councillor S. Butland  Whereas the Provincial Government has introduced legislation to pass Bill 206; and  Whereas the passage of this bill may have significant ramifications on the finances of the City of Sault Ste.

(b)   Moved by   Councillor J. Caicco  Seconded by   Councillor S. Butland  Whereas the City’s current interest rate charged on unpaid taxes is 15%; and  Whereas some members of the community have expressed serious concern about this rate being punitive and excessive; and  Whereas it is acknowledged that it is important to the City’s operations and fiscal capability, that all taxes are paid on time and that the City should not find itself financing or “carrying” taxes which may be outstanding and therefore must charge a rate which encourages timely payment to the City;  Now therefore be it resolved that the City Treasurer be asked to review the current rate as well as rates charged by other communities and report back to Council on the rationale for the current rate and any changes which he may consider appropriate. CARRIED.  The letter from the President, Sault Ste. Marie Chamber of Commerce was received by Council.  Moved by   Councillor B. Hayes  Seconded by   Councillor T.

(b)   Whereas the interest rate charged by the City of Sault Ste. Marie on overdue taxes is in line with all other municipalities; and  Whereas the purpose of an interest rate of 1 ¼% per month is to encourage timely payment of taxes for the cash flow needs of the city; and  Whereas the city has established several payment options to assist ratepayers in timely payment of taxes to avoid unnecessary interest charges; and  Whereas lowering the interest rate may in fact cause more businesses and individuals to be in tax arrears causing additional burden on staff resources; and  Whereas a reduction in taxes to accommodate the minority of businesses and homeowners who pay late will result in a reduction in interest revenue that will have to be compensated for through increases in property taxes for the majority of residents and businesses who pay taxes on time;  Now therefore be it resolved that the city leave the interest rate charged on overdue taxes at the rate of 1 ¼% per month.

Marie is now approaching full employment and employers, both small and large, are searching for new people to work, and the most recent figures on advertised occupancies for employment have reached over 2100, not including the unadvertised job market; and  Whereas Development Sault Ste. Marie, a division of the SSMEDC, and the Chamber of Commerce are receiving many calls from employers looking for new employees   that   have   skills   ranging   from   sales,   hospitality,   skilled   trades, customer contact centre representatives, to managerial level positions; and  Whereas   with   new   investments   in   the   Gateway,   SIAG   Great   Lakes   LLP, Futureshop, etc., there will be a greater need for new people to fill the new jobs that will be created as a result of these new businesses; and  Whereas the SSMEDC is becoming increasingly concerned with the potential adverse impact of labour shortages on the ability of the community to secure new investment and associated growth; and  Whereas, the SSMEDC undertook a “Saultjobs.com campaign” (EDF Fund $35,000)   in   2004   that   resulted   in   supporting   the   employee   ramp   up   and expansions of the Sutherland, Cross Country Automotive, NCO, and NuComm call centres that recruited 1400 new people and brought home approximately 72 individuals and in some cases their families to Sault Ste. Marie; and  Whereas other Cities are now launching programs to address the attraction of people   through   immigration   and   employment   strategies   that   will   support employers in finding new employees that will continue to support their business growth and expansion; and  Whereas City Council wishes to take a proactive role in supporting employers in attracting new people to Sault Ste. Marie that will ensure continued economic growth and prosperity as well as growing our population back to 80,000 + levels;  Now therefore be it resolved that City Council requests Destiny Sault Ste.

Marie residents;  Now therefore be it resolved that City Council request that Tourism Sault Ste. Marie, a division of the Economic Development Corporation, bring back a report to City Council on the feasibility of doing a similar Marketing Blitz in other areas of the Province and/or U.S. Midwest with the possible assistance of senior levels of government and that this report highlight what marketing initiatives have been undertaken in the last two years and the budgets attached to them; and  Further that Tourism SSM make recommendations to City Council about forming a   small   committee   consisting   of   Tourism   SSM,   Tourism   leaders,   City Councillors, and other representatives from the City of Sault Ste.

Caicco  Whereas the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act calls on the  Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement a plan to require a passport   or   other   document   or   combination   of   documents   deemed   to   be sufficient to denote identity and citizenship for all travel into the United States by U.S.   citizens   and   categories   of   individuals   for   whom   documentation requirements have previously been waived; and  Whereas research has demonstrated that a passport requirement is likely to reduce travel demand between Canada and United States to the detriment of both countries' tourist industries and economies; and  Whereas   there   is   little   evidence   that   the   availability   of   a   new   form   of identification such as the proposed PASS card will have substantially smaller result in curtailing travel demand than a passport requirement; and  Whereas the Department of Homeland Security has advised that there probably is insufficient time to complete the development and pilot testing of alternative secure identification options within the proposed timeframe for implementing the new documentation requirements of December 31, 2006 for individuals traveling by air and sea and December 31, 2007 for individuals traveling by land; and  Whereas evidence suggests that the public in both Canada and the U.S. is confused   about   the   timing   of   the   proposed   implementation   of   the   new regulations, many believing that they already require a passport to enter or re- enter the U.S.; 7.   (a)   Now   therefore   be   it   resolved   that   Sault   Ste.   Marie,   Ontario   City   Council expresses its concern about the risk to the economic health of communities in both the U.S.and Canada associated with the implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative in advance of the availability of an alternative document   to   the   passport   that   is   secure,   provides   proof   of   identity   and citizenship, is in a convenient format, and is inexpensive and easily obtainable. Preferred   solutions   are   based   on   enhancing   the   security   and   citizenship information on current widely carried forms of identification; and  Further resolved that the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario City Council fully supports the recommendations to extend the deadline for implementing WHTI for all forms of travel until a comprehensive economic impact study can be completed; and  Further resolved that the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario City Council supports the position   being   expressed   by   the   Binational   Tourism   Alliance   and   BESTT Coalition partners requesting amendments to the existing legislation that include (i) a single WHTI implementation date for all forms of travel;   (ii)   an exemption for children;   (iii) further development of alternative travel documents, (iv) the expansion and improvements to existing \"trusted traveller\" programs, such as NEXUS and FAST;  (v)   the undertaking of a broad and ongoing communications program clarifying the travel documents currently available and required and encouraging the public to acquire the required travel documents; and   (vi) improved training for all border services personnel to ensure consistent customer service as it relates to identification requirements at border crossings; and  THAT a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the President, The Binational Tourism Alliance for distribution to all relevant Canadian and U.S. Federal Provincial and State authorities as well as to the North American National State and   Provincial   Tourism   and   Business   organizations   involved   in   this   issue. CARRIED.  (b)   Moved by   Councillor J. Curran  Seconded by   Councillor J. Caicco  Whereas it appears that Canadians will likely require passport documentation to enter the United States as a result of recent decisions made by the government of that country; and  Whereas the need and demand for such documentation will be greatest for citizens who reside in border communities such as Sault Ste. Marie and who cross over to the United States on a regular basis for work, education and other purposes; and  Whereas the Government of Canada has set up Regional Passport Offices throughout the country taking into consideration regions of at least 100,000 population, along with distances between centers; and  Whereas in cases of emergency, residents are required to attend in person at a regional office to obtain a quick passport; and 7.   (b)   Whereas because of its location and size, Thunder Bay has been established as a Regional Office to serve the whole of Northwestern Ontario; and  Whereas   there   is   no   Regional   Office   established   to   serve   the   more   than 400,000 residents of Northeastern Ontario, thereby requiring residents, in cases of emergency, to travel to one of Thunder Bay, London, Toronto or Ottawa, Ontario for their passports; and  Whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie is the only international border community in all of Northeastern Ontario;  Now therefore be it resolved that the Federal Government be asked once more to set up a full Passport Office in Sault Ste. Marie to adequately serve the residents of Northeastern Ontario, especially in light of the increasing numbers of passports which will be required in the near future.   (Copies of this resolution to   be   sent   to   all   M.P.’s   representing   ridings   in   Northeastern   Ontario,   the Municipal Councils of the Cities of Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins and Elliot Lake and   FONOM   with   a   request   for   Resolutions   and/or   Letters   of   Support.)

Butland  Whereas on September 11   th   , 2001 all the world was saddened by the tragic loss of life that occurred when terrorists attacked the United States at the World Trade Centre in New York City and Washington DC; and  Whereas since these terrible acts caused much suffering and immense losses that occurred on that day for so many victims; and  Whereas this is the fifth anniversary of that tragic event; and  Whereas each one of us remembers that day in our individual ways, the heroic deeds of so many firefighters, police personnel and citizens;  Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Sault Ste. Marie remembers this date September 11   th   in honour of those who lost their lives five years ago today; and  Further that this resolution be forwarded to our neighbours through the Mayor of the Sault Ste.
